# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Build a RESTful API using the FastAPI framework to learn about web server development, HTTP methods, request/response handling, and creating endpoints that other applications can consume.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Create a Basic REST API

#### Description
Create a simple REST API using FastAPI that manages a collection of items (e.g., books, todos, products). The API should handle HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Set up a FastAPI application with proper initialization and imports
- Create at least 3 different endpoints using different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE)
- Implement GET endpoint(s) to retrieve all items or a specific item by ID
- Implement POST endpoint to create a new item with request validation
- Implement PUT or PATCH endpoint to update existing items
- Implement DELETE endpoint to remove items by ID
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 400, etc.)
- Include basic request and response validation


### 🛠️	Test and Document API

#### Description
Test the API endpoints to ensure they work correctly and add documentation to make it easy for other developers to understand how to use the API.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Test all endpoints using a tool like Postman, cURL, or the built-in Swagger UI
- Add docstrings or comments explaining each endpoint's purpose
- Include example requests and responses in documentation or README
- Verify that invalid requests return appropriate error messages
- Ensure the API runs without errors and handles edge cases gracefully
