## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Hangman Game

#### Description
Create a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. Players will see their progress as blank spaces that fill in with correct guesses, and they'll track remaining attempts as they make incorrect guesses.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list of words
- Accept single letter guesses from the player
- Display current progress showing guessed letters and blanks (e.g., `_ _ a _ _`)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game when the word is completely guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display appropriate win or lose messages based on the game outcome
- Handle invalid input (e.g., multiple characters, repeated guesses)
